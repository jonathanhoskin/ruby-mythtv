- Implement the Recorder class, and associated functions (see existing MythTV Python module)
- Look at how we obtain the channel icon by streaming a backend file (see existing MythTV Perl module)
- Support Ruby 1.9
- Support seeking with the MythTV::Backend#stream() method
- Work out method to remove and add database columns for Channel/Program/RecordingSchedule, as we do for the PROTOCOL mapping system. It seems the database can change without the Protocol version being bumped, so they are independent.
