- Look at how we obtain the channel icon by streaming a backend file (see existing MythTV Perl module)
- Support Ruby 1.9
- Support seeking with the MythTV::Backend#stream() method
- Look at how we need to pass the DB instance to each constructor for Channel, Program and RecordingSchedule. Automate the link back to db instance?
- Make use of the ENUMS placed in RecordingSchedule to help with validation of various columns
- Introspect column types in the database, and coerce the values into the correct class. Currently recordid is a string, for instance
